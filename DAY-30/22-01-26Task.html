                    Future is an era of Hybrid Technology. The vehicle is designed to propel
                    with electric motor and IC engine. This is developed with an intension
                    to reduce the pollution and increasing the fuel efficiency. The team of
                    students participating in the design of the vehicle is going to attend
                    Hybrid Vehicle Challenge (HVC) which is going to be organized by
                    ISIE-INDIA at National Level.

                    The project is intended to develop a Hexacopter fitted with a video
                    camera. The Hexacopter can be used for surveillance purpose. This gadget
                    is designed to help the campus security monitoring. The Hexacopter can
                    reach the areas where security personnel cannot physically reach. This
                    device can be used to monitor and control the student discipline during
                    College working hours.
